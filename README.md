# PyPress

Tools and example code to read a Facebook data export and insert bits of it into Wordpress

Includes code to

- Parse the Facebook JSON dump
- Scrape websites for titles
- Look up YouTube videos for titles
- Post to Wordpress 

Completely unsupported, poorly documented and free for you to play with!

This is not a tool you can just use, it's bits of code to cut and paste together to make your own tool.
